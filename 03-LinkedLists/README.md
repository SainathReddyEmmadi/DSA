# LinkedLists - Core Data Structure Mastery

## üìö Overview

LinkedLists are fundamental linear data structures where elements (nodes) are stored in sequence, with each node containing data and a reference (pointer) to the next node. Unlike arrays, LinkedLists don't store elements in contiguous memory locations, making them dynamic and flexible for insertion/deletion operations.

## üîó Types of LinkedLists

### 1. Singly LinkedList

- Each node points to the next node
- Can only traverse in one direction
- Memory efficient (one pointer per node)

### 2. Doubly LinkedList

- Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes
- Can traverse in both directions
- Uses more memory (two pointers per node)

### 3. Circular LinkedList

- Last node points back to the first node
- Can be singly or doubly linked
- Useful for round-robin algorithms

## ‚ö° Key Operations & Complexities

| Operation          | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes                             |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Search             | O(n)            | O(1)             | Must traverse from head           |
| Insert at Head     | O(1)            | O(1)             | Direct pointer manipulation       |
| Insert at Tail     | O(n) or O(1)\*  | O(1)             | \*O(1) if tail pointer maintained |
| Insert at Position | O(n)            | O(1)             | Need to traverse to position      |
| Delete Head        | O(1)            | O(1)             | Update head pointer               |
| Delete Tail        | O(n) or O(1)\*  | O(1)             | \*O(1) for doubly linked          |
| Delete at Position | O(n)            | O(1)             | Need to find the node             |

## üéØ Core Patterns & Techniques

### 1. Two Pointers Technique

- **Slow/Fast Pointers**: Detect cycles, find middle node
- **Distance Pointers**: Find nth node from end
- **Meeting Point**: Cycle detection and entry point

### 2. Dummy Node Pattern

- Simplifies edge cases (empty list, single node)
- Useful for insertion/deletion at head
- Maintains consistent logic

### 3. Recursive Approach

- Natural fit for LinkedList operations
- Useful for reversal, merging, and copying
- Can lead to stack overflow for very long lists

### 4. Iterative with Stack

- Simulate recursion when stack space is limited
- Useful for problems requiring backtracking
- Memory vs time trade-off

## üîß Implementation Patterns

### Basic Node Structure

```javascript
class ListNode {
  constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
  }
}
```

### Common Helper Functions

```javascript
// Convert array to linked list
function arrayToList(arr) {
  /* implementation */
}

// Convert linked list to array
function listToArray(head) {
  /* implementation */
}

// Get list length
function getLength(head) {
  /* implementation */
}

// Print list values
function printList(head) {
  /* implementation */
}
```

### Problem-Solving Template

```javascript
function solveLinkedListProblem(head) {
  // 1. Handle edge cases
  if (!head) return null;

  // 2. Initialize pointers/variables
  let current = head;
  let prev = null;

  // 3. Traverse and manipulate
  while (current) {
    // Process current node
    // Update pointers
    current = current.next;
  }

  // 4. Return result
  return newHead;
}
```

## üí° Key Insights & Tips

### 1. Edge Case Handling

- **Empty List**: Always check `if (!head)`
- **Single Node**: Consider when `head.next === null`
- **Two Nodes**: Many algorithms behave differently
- **Circular References**: Be careful with cycle creation

### 2. Pointer Management

- **Draw Diagrams**: Visualize pointer changes before coding
- **Step by Step**: Update pointers in correct order
- **Temporary Variables**: Store references before breaking links
- **Null Checks**: Always verify before dereferencing

### 3. Common Mistakes

- **Lost References**: Breaking links before storing them
- **Infinite Loops**: Not updating pointers correctly
- **Memory Leaks**: Not properly disconnecting nodes
- **Off-by-One**: Incorrect position calculations

### 4. Optimization Strategies

- **Maintain Tail Pointer**: For O(1) tail operations
- **Size Counter**: Track length for O(1) size queries
- **Dummy Head**: Simplify insertion/deletion logic
- **Two-Pass vs One-Pass**: Balance between simplicity and efficiency

## üé® Advanced Techniques

### 1. Floyd's Cycle Detection

```javascript
function hasCycle(head) {
  let slow = head,
    fast = head;
  while (fast?.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    if (slow === fast) return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

### 2. Finding Middle Node

```javascript
function findMiddle(head) {
  let slow = head,
    fast = head;
  while (fast?.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
  }
  return slow;
}
```

### 3. Reversing Sublist

```javascript
function reverseBetween(head, left, right) {
  // Complex reversal with position constraints
}
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

### LinkedList vs Array Comparison

| Aspect             | LinkedList             | Array            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Memory Access      | Non-contiguous         | Contiguous       |
| Cache Performance  | Poor                   | Excellent        |
| Random Access      | O(n)                   | O(1)             |
| Insertion/Deletion | O(1) at known position | O(n) with shifts |
| Memory Overhead    | Higher (pointers)      | Lower            |
| Memory Allocation  | Dynamic                | Static/Dynamic   |

### When to Use LinkedLists

- ‚úÖ Frequent insertions/deletions at arbitrary positions
- ‚úÖ Unknown or highly variable data size
- ‚úÖ No need for random access
- ‚úÖ Memory is fragmented
- ‚ùå Need cache-friendly performance
- ‚ùå Frequent random access required
- ‚ùå Memory is severely constrained
