## üéØ Problem-Solving Patterns Learned

### 1. Reversal Pattern

```javascript
// Three-pointer technique
let prev = null,
  current = head;
while (current) {
  let next = current.next;
  current.next = prev;
  prev = current;
  current = next;
}
```

### 2. Two-Pointer Pattern

```javascript
// Tortoise and Hare
let slow = head,
  fast = head;
while (fast && fast.next) {
  slow = slow.next;
  fast = fast.next.next;
}
```

### 3. Dummy Node Pattern

```javascript
// Simplify edge cases
const dummy = new ListNode(0);
dummy.next = head;
// ... operations
return dummy.next;
```

### 4. Gap Technique

```javascript
// Maintain distance between pointers
for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
  first = first.next;
}
while (first) {
  first = first.next;
  second = second.next;
}
```
