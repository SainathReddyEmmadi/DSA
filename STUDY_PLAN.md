## üéØ Key Success Strategies

### 1. **Follow the Pattern-Based Approach**

- Focus on understanding patterns rather than memorizing solutions
- Each problem should teach you a reusable technique
- ‚≠ê marked problems are the most important for interviews

### 2. **Practice Schedule**

- **Daily**: 2-3 problems (1 easy + 1-2 medium/hard)
- **Weekly**: Review all solved problems from that week
- **Weekend**: Focus on hard problems and pattern review

### 3. **Problem-Solving Framework**

1. **Understand**: Read problem 2-3 times, clarify edge cases
2. **Plan**: Think of brute force first, then optimize
3. **Code**: Write clean, readable code with proper variable names
4. **Test**: Run through examples mentally before submission
5. **Optimize**: Analyze time/space complexity and improve if possible

### 4. **Documentation Practice**

For each problem, document:

- Problem statement and constraints
- Multiple approaches with time/space complexity
- Key insights and patterns used
- Edge cases to remember
- Similar problems for practice

### 5. **Mock Interview Preparation**

- **Week 8+**: Start weekly mock interviews
- **Week 10+**: Daily 45-minute coding sessions
- Practice explaining your approach out loud
- Time yourself: aim for 25-30 minutes per medium problem

### 6. **Company-Specific Practice**

After completing the main curriculum, focus on:

- **FAANG**: More hard problems, system design basics
- **Startups**: Focus on practical coding, less theoretical
- **Financial**: Mathematical problems, optimization

## üìä Progress Tracking

Keep track of:

- [ ] Problems solved per week
- [ ] Time taken per problem
- [ ] Concepts that need more practice
- [ ] Patterns you struggle with
- [ ] Mock interview performance

## üéØ Final Tips

1. **Quality over Quantity**: Better to deeply understand 300 problems than to rush through 500
2. **Consistency**: Daily practice is more effective than cramming
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Focus on identifying which pattern to use
4. **Time Management**: Practice under time pressure regularly
5. **Communication**: Practice explaining your approach clearly

Remember: The goal isn't just to solve problems, but to develop strong problem-solving intuition and pattern recognition skills that will serve you well in interviews and your career!
