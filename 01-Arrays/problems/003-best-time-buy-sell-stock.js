/**
 * Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock - LeetCode Problem 121
 *
 * Problem: You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of
 * a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing
 * a single day to buy and a different day in the future to sell.
 * Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
 * - 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

/**
 * Key Insights:
 *
 * 1. GREEDY APPROACH:
 *    - We want to buy at the lowest price before the highest price
 *    - Keep track of minimum price seen so far
 *    - At each day, calculate profit if we sell today
 *
 * 2. CONNECTION TO KADANE'S ALGORITHM:
 *    - Convert to array of daily price differences
 *    - Find maximum subarray sum
 *    - This gives us the maximum profit
 *
 * 3. SINGLE TRANSACTION CONSTRAINT:
 *    - We can only buy once and sell once
 *    - Must buy before selling
 *    - If no profit possible, return 0
 *
 * 4. EDGE CASES:
 *    - Prices always decreasing (no profit)
 *    - Only one day (no transaction possible)
 *    - All prices the same (no profit)
